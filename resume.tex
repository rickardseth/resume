  Thread Group & \multicolumn {2} {v} {
    Thread is an \textbf{IPv6 based low power wireless personal area mesh network solution} designed
    to be the best way to connect and control products within the home. Member companies of the
    Thread group develop and maintain this IoT protocol as well as maintain a robust certification
    process for devices that carry the Thread logomark. More information about the group can be
    found at \href{https://www.threadgroup.org/}{ThreadGroup.org}.

    OpenThread is an \textbf{open-source} implementation of the Thread protocol created and
    maintained by Nest/Google. This \textbf{C/C++} codebase has been developed collaboratively by
    multiple product and silicon vendors. More information about the project can be found at
    \href{https://openthread.io/}{openthread.io}. The Github interactions were done with the account
    \href{https://github.com/srickardti}{@srickardti}

    While working at Texas Instruments I was responsible for multiple projects with Thread and
    OpenThread:

    \begin{itemize}[nosep, leftmargin=1em]

      \item Pushed the first new device to OpenThread on Github by adding the CC2650 Connected MCU
      \item Ported OpenThread to \textbf{TI-RTOS} and added support within the TI SimpleLink SDK

            every quarterly SDK release
      \item Wrote \textbf{reStructuredText} for the Thread User's Guide within the TI SimpleLink SDK
      \item Ported the OpenThread \textbf{Linux} border router to \textbf{BeagleBone Black} and
            continue to maintain the public guide on openthread.io and source code on Github for
            both a UART and SPI Radio CoProcessor design

  Connectivity Standards Alliance & \multicolumn {2} {v} {
    The CSA (formerly the Zigbee Alliance) is a standards organization that stewards multiple
    protocol standards such as; Matter, Zigbee, rf4ce, and more. Matter is an \textbf{IP based IoT
    framework} developed by member companies of the CSA including Google, Apple, and Amazon.  Matter
    is desinged to securly unify the fragmented home and building automation ecosystem and is based
    on industry tested protocols like Weave, HomeKit, and Zigbee. More information can be found at
    \href{https://csa-iot.org/}{csa-iot.org} and
    \href{https://buildwithmatter.com/}{buildwithmatter.com}.

    While working at Texas Instruments I was responsible for multiple projects with CSA and Matter:

    \begin{itemize}[nosep, leftmargin=1em]

      \item Pushed support for the CC2652 and CC2652R7 device families to the connectedhomeip
            repository
      \item \textbf{Represented Texas Instruments} at the Matter technical,
            certification, and marketing working group meeting
      \item Participated in early Matter test events to validate the specification and SDK for
            release
